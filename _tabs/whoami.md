Hello 👋

I’m an engineering student in France talking about computer science and more specifically security, learning everyday new stuff on infosec !

That’s why I spend (too much) time on Root-Me and try to participate in CTFS.

I'm also the president of the cybersecurity club at my school, called [Securitiie](https://securitiie.github.io)

## University background

- DUT Informatique : Two years learning the basics of computer science
- Licence 3 Informatique : Bachelor of computer science at Paris-Saclay university
- Engineering school ENSIIE in computer science (Eq. Msc) : among the prestigious schools in France (“Grandes écoles”)
